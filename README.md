Ecommerce Proof of Concept (Spring Boot + React)
This project is a semi-functional ecommerce site built as a proof of concept using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. While not fully polished, it demonstrates core functionality such as CRUD operations, file uploads, and API integration.

Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository

git clone <repo-url>
cd <project-folder>

2. Set Up the Backend (Spring Boot)
Ensure you have JDK 21 installed.

Navigate to the backend directory:
cd backend

Set up the H2 database connection:
Open src/main/resources/application.properties and ensure the spring.datasource.url is correctly set.
The database URL should match the one used in application.properties to avoid connection issues.

Run the backend application:
mvn spring-boot:run
This will start the Spring Boot server.

4. Set Up the Frontend (React)
Navigate to the frontend directory:
cd frontend

Install dependencies:
npm install

Start the frontend:
npm start
This will launch the React development server.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
Database Configuration: If the application fails to connect, double-check the H2 database URL in application.properties.
Known Issues: Some features are not fully implemented due to time constraints, but the core functionality demonstrates the integration between Spring Boot and React.
API Integration: Attempts were made to integrate external APIs for product metadata, but this is still a work in progress.
